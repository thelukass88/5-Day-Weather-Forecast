## Description

Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The link should take you to a guide on how to use the 5 Day Forecast API. 

The base URL for your API calls should look like the following: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`.

You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. F

## Comments

Successfully used fetch to draw data from openweatherapp API. 
Page dynamically updates on fetch call and responds to user input.

Still finding local storage challenging. Unale to get local storage to store input data.
